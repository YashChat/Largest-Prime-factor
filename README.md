# Largest-Prime-factor
Write a recursive algorithm for determining the largest prime factor of a number N.

The largest prime factor of 100 is 5 because 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5. 
We write a recursive algorithm for determining the largest prime factor of a number N.

public static long largestPrimeFactor(long num) which takes a
number as argument and should return the largest prime factor of num. 
Note that we are using long values here, so you can expect some of the input values to be very large.
That means we need to consider the efficiency of the solution.
