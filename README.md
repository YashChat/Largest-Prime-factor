# Largest-Prime-factor
Write a recursive algorithm for determining the largest prime factor of a number N.

The largest prime factor of 100 is 5 because 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5. 
We write a recursive algorithm for determining the largest prime factor of a number N.

public static long largestPrimeFactor(long num) which takes a
number as argument and should return the largest prime factor of num.
